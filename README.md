# scotland-planning

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of scotland-planning is to refresh my memory on how to build a
Shiny app that leverages Leaflet.

Additionally, I am using this as a use case to:

- Setup a shiny.io account and publish shiny apps
- Explore the arrow package (probably unneccesarily for this use case)
- Tinker with playing around solving a traveling salesman problem for
  trip planning
